Ruth is a simple macro processor that copies a file or directory, filling in
templates as it goes. It has just one non-trivial construct:
context-dependent file inclusion. A file can either be included literally,
or run as a command and its output included.

Ruth was originally designed to build simple static web sites, but can be
used for all sorts of other tasks, similar to more complicated systems like
[AutoGen] and [TXR].

[TXR]: http://www.nongnu.org/txr

Ruth is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL version 3 (or, at your
option, any later version), and written in TypeScript.

See the [Cookbook](Cookbook.md) for instructions and examples.

## Installation

It's easiest to install Ruth with npm:

```
$ npm install -g @sc3d/ruth
```

## Invocation

$paste{sh,-c,./bin/run --help | build-aux/indent-preformatted}

## Operation <a name="operation"></a>

Ruth builds a path given a template as follows:

1. Set the initial text to `\$include{TEMPLATE}`, unless `TEMPLATE` is `-`,
   in which case set the initial text to the contents of standard input.
2. Scan the text for commands. Expand any arguments to the command, run each
   command, and replace the command by the result.
3. Output the resultant text, eliding any final newline. (This last part may
   look tricky, but it almost always does what you want, and makes
   `\$include` behave better in various contexts.)

A command takes the form `\$COMMAND` or `\$COMMAND{ARGUMENT, ...}`. To
prevent a comma from being interpreted as an argument separator, put a
backslash in front of it:

    \$include{cat,I\,Robot.txt,3 Rules of Robotics.txt}

This will run the command as if it had been typed:

    cat "I, Robot.txt" "3 Rules of Robotics.txt"

Similarly, a command can be treated as literal text by putting a backslash in front of it:

    Now I can talk about \\$paste.

This will output:

    Now I can talk about \$paste.

Ruth recognises these commands:

* *`\$include{FILE}`* Look up the given source file; read its contents, then
  expand them (that is, execute any commands found therein) and return the
  result.
* *`\$paste{FILE}`* Like `\$include`, but does not expand its result before
  returning it.
* *`\$path`* Return the `PATH` argument.
* *`\$root`* Return the root directory.

The last two commands are mostly useful as arguments to `\$include` and
`\$paste`.

To find the source file `FILE` specified by a `\$include{FILE}` command,
Ruth proceeds thus:

1. See whether `ROOT/PATH/FILE` is a file (or a symbolic link to a file). If
   so, return the file path.
2. If not, remove the last directory from `PATH` and try again, until `PATH`
   is empty.
3. Try looking for `ROOT/FILE`.

If no file is found, Ruth stops with an error message.

For example, if the root directory is `/dir`, `PATH` is `foo/bar/baz`, and
Ruth is trying to find `file.html`, it will try the following files, in
order:

1. `/dir/foo/bar/baz/file.html`
2. `/dir/foo/bar/file.html`
3. `/dir/foo/file.html`
4. `/dir/file.html`

There is one exception to this rule: if the file being searched for has the
same name as the file currently being expanded, then the search starts at
the next directory up. This avoids an endless loop, and can also be useful.

See the [website example](Cookbook.md#website-example) in the Cookbook for a
worked example.

### Running other programs

In addition to the rules given above, Ruth also allows `\$include` and
`\$paste` to take their input from programs. This can be useful in a variety
of ways: to insert the current date or time, to make a calculation, or to
convert a file to a different format.

Ruth can run a program in two ways:

1. If a file found by an `\$include` or `\$paste` command has the “execute”
   permission, it is run.

2. If no file of the given name can be found using the rules in the previous
   section, Ruth looks for an executable file on the user’s `PATH` (the
   list of directories specified by the `PATH` environment variable), as if
   with the `which` command. If one is found, it is run. (This possibility
   is not mentioned in the Cookbook, but it is not very likely that
   Ruth will find a file called `file.html` somewhere on the user’s `PATH`,
   since executables don’t normally end in `.html`.)

In either case, arguments may be passed to the program: use `\$include{FILE,
ARGUMENT_1, ARGUMENT_2, …}`, or the equivalent for `\$paste`.

For example, to insert the current date:

    \$paste{date,+%Y-%m-%d}

See the [date example](Cookbook.md#date-example) in the Cookbook for more
detail.

When commands that run programs are nested inside each other, the order in
which they are run may matter. Ruth only guarantees that if one command is
nested inside another, the inner command will be processed first. There is
no guarantee of the order in which commands at the same nesting level are
run.
